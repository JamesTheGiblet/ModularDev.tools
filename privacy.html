                <h2>1. What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
                <p><strong>Personal information you disclose to us:</strong> We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the Services, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us. This may include names, email addresses, usernames, passwords, and billing information.</p>
                <p><strong>Information automatically collected:</strong> We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information.</p>

                <h2>2. How Do We Process Your Information?</h2>
                <p>We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent. We process your information for purposes based on legitimate business interests, the fulfillment of our contract with you, compliance with our legal obligations, and/or your consent.</p>

                <h2>3. When and With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information?</h2>
                <p>We may share information in specific situations and with specific third parties. We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. Examples include: payment processing (e.g., Stripe), data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, and customer service.</p>

                <h2>4. Do We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies?</h2>
                <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.</p>

                <h2>5. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
                <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information.</p>

                <h2>6. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>
                <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.</p>

                <h2>7. What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h2>
                <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and California), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time by logging into your account settings.</p>

                <h2>8. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h2>
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.</p>

                <h2>9. Do We Make Updates to This Notice?</h2>
                <p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last Updated" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>

                <h2>10. How Can You Contact Us About This Notice?</h2>
                <p>If you have questions or comments about this notice, you may email us at privacy@modulardev.tools or contact us via the contact form on our website.</p>
